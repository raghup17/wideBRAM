This project was referenced by a BSP project, which will now fail to compile properly.

We recommend that you create a new BSP project pointing to a valid hardware project. Alternatively, you can fix the project references in the BSP, and update the path to the hardware specification file in 'libgen.options', and in ELF check options in dependant applications.

14:02:26.074 ERROR - SDK has detected that project wideBRAM_bsp has been deleted (or renamed).
If this project was a BSP referenced by other C/C++ applications, then those applications will fail to build now. Please right click on those applications and click 'Change Referenced BSP' to update those projects' BSP references.
