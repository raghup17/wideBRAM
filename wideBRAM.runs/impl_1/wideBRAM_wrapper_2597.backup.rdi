INFO: [Vivado 12-1399] There are no top level ports directly connected to pins of cell 'wideBRAM_i/proc_sys_reset/U0', returning the pins matched for query '[get_ports ext_reset_in]' of cell 'wideBRAM_i/proc_sys_reset/U0'. [/home/raghu/work/projects/wideBRAM/wideBRAM.srcs/sources_1/bd/wideBRAM/ip/wideBRAM_proc_sys_reset_0/wideBRAM_proc_sys_reset_0.xdc:55]
Resolution: The get_ports call is being converted to a get_pins call as there is no direct connection to a top level port. This could be due to the insertion of IO Buffers between the top level terminal and cell pin. If the goal is to apply constraints that will migrate to top level ports it is required that IO Buffers manually be instanced.
